About Eric:

My name is Eric Henderson. I am a degree seeking Web Development student with two years of experience learning about and implementing frontend technologies. I have experience building projects in frontend Frameworks such as Vue.js and React.js. These projects are styled with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. I have connected these projects to backend and storage providers like Supabase and Firebase. 
Once my degree is earned, I hope to pursue a career in Frontend Software Development and eventually full stack development. I look forward to delving into mobile development, as well as sharpening my backend skills over time.
